# Banal Coding Test

Instructions

1. Figure out what this function does

If the function was written well and/or documented to a decent standard, one
would not have to make the effort.  I hate stupid tests like this.  THey
show ernormous disrespect for the people who bother to respond to your
position requirements.  "we have written something CLEVER and CRYPTIC".
Now you can waste your time figuring it out.

2. Write a unit test for it
3. Refactor for readability and efficiency

NOTE: Do regular commits that show agile style iterations through the problem.
If you prefer a different language, you can provide your solution in PHP, 
Python or Javascript too.
